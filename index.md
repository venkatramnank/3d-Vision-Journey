# 3D Vision : Journey into 3D Vision

Date : July 8 2023

This is the beginning of Venkatâ€™s journey into 3D computer vision. His current knowledge include: Some Deep Learning, Python and Pytorch(learning to write clean code and commit properly (he just merges ðŸ˜…)). Well, in terms of computer vision, he knows the basics. But in terms of 3D computer vision, he currently knows s**t ðŸ˜‚!!

But he really feels a connect to this topic and is trying to improve ðŸ¤”.

This journey splits into 4 parts:

1. Introduction and getting hands dirty (IGHD)
2. Mathematics of 3D vision and corresponding deep learning (Math)
3. Pytorch (coding)
4. Getting in hand with latest research (res)
