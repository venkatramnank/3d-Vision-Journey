# Journey into 3D Vision

This is the beginning of Venkat’s journey into 3D computer vision. His current knowledge include: Some Deep Learning, Python and Pytorch(learning to write clean code and commit properly (he just merges 😅)). Well, in terms of computer vision, he knows the basics. But in terms of 3D computer vision, he currently knows s**t 😂!!

But he really feels a connect to this topic and is trying to improve 🤔.

This journey splits into 4 parts:

Introduction and getting hands dirty (IGHD)
Mathematics of 3D vision and corresponding deep learning (Math)
Pytorch (coding)
Getting in hand with latest research (res)
